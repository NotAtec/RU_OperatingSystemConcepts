# RU Operating System Concepts - Projects
These are the projects Jeske Groenheiden and I have made for the Radboud Computing Science course "Operating System Concepts"
All are placed in their respective folders.

## Shell
The first project was a simple shell implementation in C++. Pre-made were the parsers, and our task was to implement a function that could execute the contents of an "Expression" object.

We were expected to handle piping, basic internal commands like `exit` and `cd`, and running external commands with forked processes.

Basic File I/O is also implemented with `<` and `>` operators in the command line.

## Buffer

## TBA
